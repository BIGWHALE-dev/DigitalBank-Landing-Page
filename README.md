### What I learned

This is my second coding challenge, and I really... all I can say is that I reached a milestone in learning new styles, properties, values, attributes and tactics of/for coding, and I'll say it's really an achievement and a privilege, and I'm trully happy and thankful for this. I won't lie the project is a bit hardcore, but I tackled it with all i got and all I can find, and learned a lot on the way. So thank you "Frontend Mentor" for giving me the privilege and opportunity...🙏🙏

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  height: clamp();
  width: min();
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log(new IntersectionObserver());
};
```
